- Add iter() and iter_mut, and their corresponding iterator structs
- Add insert, remove and other functions, taking/returning Iterators
- Add push (alias for append) and pop routines (base pop on remove with the iterator as the _tail node)
- Add useful traits to LastLinkedList
- Organise directory structure, addling LLL to modules, packages, etc.
- Make sure any iterators used also implement the custom drop() function used in LastLinkedList
- Add _previous field to all iterators.
    - This will be used in functions like insert and remove for repairing the list after insertions and removals
- Create generic function for dropping LLL and iterators, instead of copying code
